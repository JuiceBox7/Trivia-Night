# Trivia-Night
A simple game of trivia

## Goal
A fun personal project created in order to experiment and hone skills in full-stack development  
Also to create a simple, fun game of trivia for users to enjoy!

## To-Do
**Priority**  
- Make a Next button and dont just go to next question  
- Move functionality to Next button's onClick function  
- Make the result text go away after a few seconds (maybe 2) and for sure go away when clicking next  
- Fix title css absolute position to flex or smth  

**Stretch Goals/Near Future**  
- Timer for questions (maybe increasing difficulty or set difficulty)
- A start screen/menu instead of straight trivia
- Music???
- Implement Flask Backend with MySQL Database for trivia questions, answers, choices  
- Implement AI functionality for creating choices to act as red herrings to the actual answer  
- If the above idea fails, maybe just use AI for smarter parsing/selecting of questions from database (maybe like a "give me fall themed trivia questions" and it makes a deck of random trivia questions)  

**Far Future Goals/Huge Maybes**  
- Allow users to upload their own trivia decks
